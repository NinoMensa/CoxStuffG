        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Godwin. I am newly experienced programmer and in this project, I have decided to learn how to create a website using HTML and CSS. 
            I am fully inexperienced in this laguage but I am using W3Schools as a guide.
            I am a musician with 8 years experience in piano, 1 year in guitar and currently developing my vocal skills.
            On this website, I am going to try my best to develop a solution that will aid myself with my practice routime. 
            It will serve as a guide in my learning.
